# Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

#### Type Guards are an essential concept in TypeScript that helps ensure type safety in a program. By narrowing down the types of variables, Type Guards help developers avoid runtime errors and make the code more reliable. This becomes especially important in real-world applications, such as a Muslim Todo App, where we want to ensure that the data types we are working with are correct at all stages.

#### In this blog post, weâ€™ll discuss the necessity of Type Guards in TypeScript, provide examples, and explore various types of Type Guards using a Muslim Todo App scenario.

## What Are Type Guards?

Type Guards in TypeScript are methods that help narrow the type of a variable within a certain scope. By using Type Guards, we can check the type of a variable and perform operations accordingly, ensuring that our program handles variables safely based on their type.

## Why Are Type Guards Necessary?

Type Guards are necessary because they allow developers to handle variables that could have multiple types in a safe and efficient way. Without Type Guards, TypeScript would only perform surface-level checks, making it difficult to work with variables that have more complex or varied types. Type Guards ensure that we can make decisions about the specific type of a variable, allowing our code to be more predictable and bug-free.

## Various Types of Type Guards in TypeScript

#### There are several ways to define and use Type Guards in TypeScript, including:

typeof Type Guards
instanceof Type Guards
User-Defined Type Guards

### 1. typeof Type Guards

The typeof operator is used to check the type of a variable. It is most commonly used for primitive types such as string, number, boolean, etc.

## Example: Todo App with typeof

In our Muslim Todo App, we may want to allow users to create tasks for prayer times, like Fajr, Dhuhr, and Isha. We can use a union type to store the tasks in the todo list and use a typeof Type Guard to check whether the task is a string or a number before handling it.

```
type Task = string | number;

const addTask = (task: Task): void => {
  if (typeof task === "string") {
    console.log(`Task added: ${task}`);
  } else if (typeof task === "number") {
    console.log(`Task added with time (in minutes): ${task}`);
  }
};

const task1: Task = "Fajr Prayer";
const task2: Task = 30;  // Time for Dhuhr Prayer

addTask(task1);  // Output: Task added: Fajr Prayer
addTask(task2);  // Output: Task added with time (in minutes): 30

```

#### In this example, task can either be a string (e.g., the name of a prayer) or a number (e.g., the number of minutes for a specific prayer time). Using typeof, we can safely handle each type.

## 2. instanceof Type Guards

#### The instanceof operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a particular class. This is useful for checking types of objects that are derived from classes.

#### Example: Using instanceof with Todo Task Classes

In our app, we might have different types of tasks, such as PrayerTask and ReminderTask, each of which is a class. We can use the instanceof Type Guard to check the task type before performing actions

```
class PrayerTask {
  constructor(public name: string, public time: number) {}
}

class ReminderTask {
  constructor(public message: string) {}
}

type Task = PrayerTask | ReminderTask;

const handleTask = (task: Task): void => {
  if (task instanceof PrayerTask) {
    console.log(`Prayer Task: ${task.name} at ${task.time} minutes.`);
  } else if (task instanceof ReminderTask) {
    console.log(`Reminder Task: ${task.message}`);
  }
};

const task1 = new PrayerTask("Isha Prayer", 10);
const task2 = new ReminderTask("Call for Prayer");

handleTask(task1);  // Output: Prayer Task: Isha Prayer at 10 minutes.
handleTask(task2);  // Output: Reminder Task: Call for Prayer

```

In this example, instanceof helps us narrow down whether the task is a PrayerTask or ReminderTask, enabling us to handle them differently.

## 3. User-Defined Type Guards

##### Sometimes, we may need to create our own Type Guard functions to check for more complex types or structures. This is particularly useful when we want to check multiple conditions or validate data more thoroughly.

#### Example: User-Defined Type Guard for Task Deadline

We could define a custom type guard to check if a task has a valid deadline (e.g., a date), which would be an important feature in a Todo app for setting reminders before prayer times.

```

interface TaskWithDeadline {
  name: string;
  deadline: Date;
}

function isTaskWithDeadline(task: Task): task is TaskWithDeadline {
  return (task as TaskWithDeadline).deadline !== undefined;
}

const task1 = { name: "Fajr Prayer", deadline: new Date("2024-12-01T05:00:00") };
const task2 = { name: "Reminder", deadline: undefined };

if (isTaskWithDeadline(task1)) {
  console.log(`${task1.name} has a deadline of ${task1.deadline}`);
} else {
  console.log(`${task1.name} doesn't have a deadline.`);
}

if (isTaskWithDeadline(task2)) {
  console.log(`${task2.name} has a deadline of ${task2.deadline}`);
} else {
  console.log(`${task2.name} doesn't have a deadline.`);
}

```

Here, isTaskWithDeadline is a custom Type Guard function that checks if the task has a deadline property. This allows us to safely check whether a task has a deadline before using it.

## Conclusion: Why Type Guards Matter

In a Muslim Todo App, ensuring that the tasks and reminders are handled correctly based on their types is crucial for providing an accurate and seamless experience. Type Guards help ensure that the types of data we are working with are checked and narrowed down correctly, making our code more reliable and reducing the chances of bugs.

By using Type Guards like typeof, instanceof, and user-defined guards, we can create robust applications that safely handle multiple types and ensure proper behavior under various conditions. Whether it's handling prayer times, task deadlines, or reminders, Type Guards provide the safety and flexibility needed for clean and efficient TypeScript code.
